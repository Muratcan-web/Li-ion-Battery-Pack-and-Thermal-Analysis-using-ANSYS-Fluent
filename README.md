# BMS-for-a-Li-ion-Battery-Pack-and-Thermal-Analysis-using-ANSYS-Fluent
In this project, I presented a review of existing battery technologies, their advantages & disadvantages and management techniques. Also, I simulated the thermal analysis of a certain battery pack using ANSYS Fluent. Depending on the thermal analysis, I suggested a cooling method.
The Battery Management System is modified from TIDA 00717 BMS design. I applied a couple of modifications and draw a passive balancing based system on Altium. The schematic and PCB files are presented in this repository.
Pleae refer to the review articel I wrote "A review of Rechargable Li-Ion Battery packs, Battery Management Systems, Thermal Analysis of a Battery Pack, Fundammental Methods to Determine Important Battery Properties" for detailed information about my study.
